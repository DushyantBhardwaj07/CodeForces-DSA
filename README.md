# CodeForces-DSA

This repository contains my solutions to CodeForces problems compiled from various resources.

## Structure

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal, etc.
- **Problem Sets**: Directories for specific CodeForces contest problems or practice sets.

Each folder typically includes codes written in multiple languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java) and may have additional resources like problem statements or links to the original problems on CodeForces.

Feel free to explore for learning, reference, or personal use!
